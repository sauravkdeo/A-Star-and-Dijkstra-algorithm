## Dependencies
- Google Mock
- CMake version at least 3.2
- Google Test

## Standard install via command-line and program run
```
unzip the files to a location
cd <path to repository>
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
Run program: ./app/Project2
```

## Building for code coverage
```
sudo apt-get install lcov
cmake -D COVERAGE=ON -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ../
make
make code_coverage
```
This generates a index.html page in the build/coverage sub-directory that can be viewed locally in a web browser.
